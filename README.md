In this project, you will use Ruby's File class and your knowledge of iterators to calculate the frequency of words in a text file. A starter file with a class and some method names is provided, as is a test suite for your code.

To calculate the frequency of words, you must:

remove punctuation
normalize all words to lowercase
remove "stop words" -- words used so frequently they are ignored
go through the file word by word and keep a count of how often each word is used
